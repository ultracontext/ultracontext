**All agents. One context.**

The Context Hub automatically syncs all your agents' contexts to a single place in real time. Every agent, every machine, every team member.

Anyone on your team can access any agent session from anywhere. Fork a session started by a colleague on another machine. Resume a Claude Code conversation with Codex. Switch agents, switch machines — the context follows.

## Components

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ingestor** | Background daemon that monitors agent session files, parses events, and syncs them to the Context API |
| **Interface** | Terminal dashboard that shows sync status, logs, and lets you manage everything |

## How it works

```
Claude Code        Codex        OpenClaw
      |              |              |
      v              v              v
+--------------------------------------------+
|                Ingestor                    |
|                                            |
|    watch -> parse -> dedup -> process      |
|                                            |
+--------------------------------------------+
      |                             |
      | WebSocket                   | HTTPS
      v                             v
+----------------+       +-------------------+
|   Interface    |       |   Context API     |
+----------------+       +-------------------+
```

You interact with both through a single CLI:

```bash bash
ultracontext          # start ingestor + open TUI
ultracontext start    # start ingestor only
ultracontext tui      # open TUI only
ultracontext stop     # stop ingestor
ultracontext status   # check if ingestor is running
ultracontext update   # update CLI globally
```

## Supported agents

| Agent | Session files |
|-------|-------------|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` |
| **Codex** | `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` |
| **OpenClaw** | `~/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions/**/*.jsonl` |

## What happens when you run it

1. The ingestor starts as a detached background process (logs to `~/.ultracontext/daemon.log`)
2. New events are parsed, deduplicated, and ingested using the Context API
3. You can view everything on the interface
